teaguejt

My name is Joe Teague. I grew up in Maine and Massachusettes, but have been in Tennessee since high school. I am a senior in Computer Science and will graduate in the spring. My primary interest and field of study is operating systems, but there aren't a lot of aspects of the field that don't interest me. I have professional experience in IT with the Department of Energy in Oak Ridge and as a mobile application developer for SAIC. In my free time I enjoy playing and listening to music, riding my motorcycle, working on the antique car I'm restoring, and, of course, programming.
