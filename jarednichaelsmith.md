- My name is Jared Smith, and I am an honors computer science major in my junior year. I have worked at Cisco as a software security engineer, the Center for Intelligent Systems and Machine Learning as a software engineer, and the High Energy Particle Physics Group as an undergraduate researcher. I am currently a Cybersecurity researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I am also the co-founder and VP of HackUTK, UT's first and only computer security organization. I have also been working for a startup in Knoxville this summer which recently got venture capital and angel investor funding.
 - I primarily write in Python, C/C++, JavaScript, and Go, though I have some experience writing Haskell at Cisco. I love computer security, data mining and machine learning, and bio-inspired computation.
