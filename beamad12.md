My name is Madeleine Beatty and I am a second year in the Masters of Science in Business Analytics program here at UT. I have a background in pure math, the pinnacle of my undergraduate career was defining and presenting a connection between combinatorial game theory and Galois theory. This connection involved the galois fields of the Fermat 2-powers, nim multiplication and turning sets. If you asked me about this project I would likely not be able to talk about it intelligently anymore.
  I applied to the MSBA program because a close friend from undergraduate had gone through the program and liked it and I was burnt out on pure math and was looking for a more applied graduate program. My interests haven't changed much; I enjoy rigorous math that's based in theory, i.e. nothing is assumed but is derived. I do however value application more than I did as an undergraduate. That is, I used to align more with G. H. Hardy and instead would align my views more with Hilbert. An interesting problem is an interesting problem. 
  Last summer I interned at Washington State Department of Transportation where I built and implemented a planning tool that is now used statewide. This summer I interned at Amazon and built three predictive models that are all working but that I will continue with when I graduate in December. 
  Random Facts:
  My goals for this class are to come away with a solid understanding of Digital Archeology as well as build on my IT and programming knowledge. 
  I am a single Mom and my daughters name is Mathilde, she started kindergarten this year. 
  I took second place in the longest crew shell row in the world (115mi)--yes I love this fact, I thought I might die during that row.
  I am originally from Washington State
